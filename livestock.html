         <strong>Investment in livestock in Sudan</strong> serves as the second main station of Tantawy International, which stands for one distance of agricultural investment in relation to the company's strategy in its activities and its complement, and the first beneficiary, and the harvest machine, which ensures the provision of a good and integrated feed product and variety of elements. The living heads of cows and flocks, including at least 90 million heads of the lowest estimate and with the availability of the vast agricultural area, gathered elements of success towards a promising investment of animal production and meat in front of the company Tantawi.</p>

         <p>
           And where it became in the same place of the objectives of the company Tantawi, to provide a product of packaged meat and derivatives of a distinct nature can compete with international products in quality and price, which are often received from countries far geographically from the Arab and African region can not only reach both slaughtered frozen nature, Or live, mostly high taste different from the local taste, which is used by the Arab citizen.
         </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, the company adopted an <strong>investment budget of 20 million dollars</strong> to complete an important march towards the production and processing of fresh, chilled meat with a validity of not less than 30 full days, through investment in animal production and investment in the establishment of the massacres within and outside the Sudan can reach the consumer Throughout the Arab world of beef and lamb meat throughout the year, Tantawi targeted the Egyptian market in particular with a population density at the start of export in 2011, which exceeded 80 million people depend on meat consumption on the import of about 1.296 million tons of snow With a total value of $ 5.3 billion, mostly from Brazil, Australia, Eastern Europe and India.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Al-Tantawi company started exporting in 2011 to the Egyptian market at 250 tons of beef</strong>, cooled monthly by air freight. On the basis of this, the markets were opened and graduated to reach 1000 tons per month. This was adopted to establish a broad base for marketing through consumer complexes and cooperative prices. Strategic, as well as civil society, retailers, supermarkets and hypermarkets
      </p>
      <p>
        Sudanese meat is characterized by its good nature and health due to its food on natural green fodder. It became a meat with a distinctive taste, which led to the transformation of the Egyptian consumer to a great ability, which was used to local meat. Sudanese meat contributes significantly to covering the growing market demand. Fresh Sudanese prices of imported frozen meat created a great competitive for the acquisition of Sudanese fresh meat on a large segment of consumers in the market, and became in the consumption of all segments of consumers to eat Sudanese meat, especially for Sudanese meat price difference 30% less than the local meat price
      </p>
      <p>
        The entry of the middle class and above the Egyptian medium in the segment of consumers of Sudanese meat due to the choice of a balanced protein alternative is close to what used to the top of this segment, which has a higher consumption rate than other segments.
      </p>
      <p>
        - This approach combines a strong doctrine for large and successive expansions to complete the work base, and the construction of a quarry and a bombardment in the city of Abu Simbel on the southern Egyptian border at an estimated cost of 5 million US dollars to provide a high quality product and supplement the slaughterhouse to take advantage of all the remnants of the slaughter process and achieve high economic value and abundance
